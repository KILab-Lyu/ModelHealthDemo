# ModelHealth: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Graph Learning Models

ModelHealth is a comprehensive diagnostic system designed to evaluate graph learning models across six critical dimensions: **Effectiveness**, **Embedding Quality**, **Compatibility**, **Robustness**, **Efficiency**, and **Maintainability**. Unlike traditional evaluation tools, which focus on isolated metrics, ModelHealth offers a holistic view of a modelâ€™s overall performance, generating a detailed "health report" that provides valuable insights into both the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated model.

In addition, ModelHealth leverages large language models (LLMs) to offer personalized, actionable optimization suggestions, helping users refine their models efficiently. The framework also includes a comparison module that allows users to benchmark their models against others, making it easier to identify areas for improvement.
