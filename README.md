# ModelHealth:ModelHealth: A Holistic Framework for Evaluating and Diagnosing Graph Learning Models
**ModelHealth** is an innovative and comprehensive diagnostic system designed specifically for evaluating and optimizing graph learning models. It assesses models across six critical dimensions: **Effectiveness** , **Embedding Quality** , **Compatibility** , **Robustness** , **Efficiency** , and **Maintainability** . Unlike traditional evaluation tools, which focus mainly on isolated metrics such as accuracy or computational cost, **ModelHealth** provides a holistic and multi-dimensional view of a model's performance. 

With **ModelHealth**, you can generate a detailed "health report" üìù that offers in-depth insights into both the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated model.  Additionally, by integrating **large language models (LLMs)** , ModelHealth provides personalized, actionable optimization suggestions that help users refine their models efficiently and improve their performance across all dimensions. The system also includes a **model comparison module** , which allows users to benchmark their models against other models, facilitating a deeper understanding of how their model compares in real-world applications.
